## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See form validation messages if any field is incomplete
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - For styles


### What I learned

I improved my handling of input styling and functionality while also gaining a better understanding of CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout structuring. I learned to use semantic HTML for better accessibility and applied React state management to update inputs and results dynamically.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to improve my range input styling and accessibility. I also aim to refine my CSS Grid and Flexbox skills for better responsiveness. Additionally, I plan to learn TypeScript to write better-structured and maintainable code.
